      # By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up. 
      # Unless specified otherwise, the Discovery Client does not propagate the current health check status of the application, 
      # per the Spring Boot Actuator. Consequently, after successful registration, Eureka always announces that the application 
      # is in 'UP' state. This behavior can be altered by enabling Eureka health checks, 
      # which results in propagating application status to Eureka. As a consequence, 
      # every other application does not send traffic to applications in states other then 'UP'.
